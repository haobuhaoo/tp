# ClassConnect User Guide

ClassConnect is a desktop app designed for private tutors to **easily manage their students, lessons, and administrative tasks** — from lesson scheduling and homework tracking to payments and reminders — all in one place.

While ClassConnect is optimized for **fast command-based input (CLI)**, it also offers the convenience of a **clean and intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI)**. This means you get the speed and precision of typing commands — perfect for tutors who want to make quick updates during or after lessons — without losing the visual clarity that helps you see all your students, schedules, and reminders at a glance.

ClassConnect helps you:

* **Maintain organized student profiles** including names, phone number, and lesson times.

* **Track homework progress, participation and payment status** with visual indicators.

* **Group students** for easier class and schedule management.

* **Set reminders** for important events, upcoming lessons, or follow-ups.

* Automatically **save your data**, ensuring your records are always up to date.

With ClassConnect, you can focus more on teaching and less on administrative work — **making student management simpler, faster, and more reliable.

## Quick start

Follow the steps below to set up and start using ClassConnect:

1. **Check your Java version**<br>
   * Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer. You can verify this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:`java -version`.
   * **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).
   * If you do not have Java installed, download it from the [official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17?er=221886).

1. **Download ClassConnect**<br>
   * Download the latest `classconnect.jar` file from [the releases page](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F12-2/tp/releases).

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. **Run the application**
   * Choose a folder on your computer where you want to keep ClassConnect. This can be any folder you are comfortable with, such as `Documents/ClassConnect`.
   * Copy the `classconnect.jar` file you downloaded into that folder.
   * Open the terminal / command prompt:
     * Windows: Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter.
     * Mac: Open `Terminal` from Applications → Utilities.
     * Linux: Open your terminal application.
   * Navigate to the folder where you saved `classconnect.jar`.
     * For example, if you saved it in Documents/ClassConnect, type `cd Documents/ClassConnect` in the terminal and press `Enter`.
   * Run the application by typing `java -jar classconnect.jar` into the terminal and press `Enter`.

4. **Familiarize yourself with the interface**
   * When ClassConnect launches, you will see both the command line panel (for typing commands) and the main display panel (showing your students, lessons, and reminders).
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

5. **Start managing your data**
   * Try entering your first command to add a student: `add-student n/John Doe p/98765432 t/1000 Wed`.
   * The student `John Doe` will appear at the bottom of the main panel immediately after the command is executed.

6. **Explore more commands**
   * Refer to the [Features](#features) section for a full list of commands and usage examples.

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>e.g. in `add-student n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add-student n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>e.g. `n/NAME [t/LESSON_TIME]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/1000` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `...` after them can be used multiple times but minimally once.<br>
  e.g. `t/LESSON_TIME...` can be used as `t/1000 Sun`, `t/1230 Fri t/0900 Sat` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE`, `p/PHONE n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Saving the data

ClassConnect data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

ClassConnect data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/classconnect.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, ClassConnect will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the ClassConnect to behave in unexpected ways (e.g. if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

</box>

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous ClassConnect home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
