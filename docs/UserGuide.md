# ClassConnect User Guide

ClassConnect is a desktop app designed for private tutors to **easily manage their students, lessons, and administrative tasks** — from lesson scheduling and homework tracking to payments and reminders — all in one place.

While ClassConnect is optimized for **fast command-based input (CLI)**, it also offers the convenience of a **clean and intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI)**. This means you get the speed and precision of typing commands — perfect for tutors who want to make quick updates during or after lessons — without losing the visual clarity that helps you see all your students, schedules, and reminders at a glance.

ClassConnect helps you:

* **Maintain organized student profiles** including names, phone number, and lesson times.

* **Track homework progress, participation and payment status** with visual indicators.

* **Group students** for easier class and schedule management.

* **Set reminders** for important events, upcoming lessons, or follow-ups.

* Automatically **save your data**, ensuring your records are always up to date.

With ClassConnect, you can focus more on teaching and less on administrative work — **making student management simpler, faster, and more reliable**.

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>e.g. in `add-student n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add-student n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>e.g. `n/NAME [t/LESSON_TIME]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/1000` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `...` after them can be used multiple times but minimally once.<br>
  e.g. `t/LESSON_TIME...` can be used as `t/1000 Sun`, `t/1230 Fri t/0900 Sat` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE`, `p/PHONE n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Note:**<br>

* Using the prefix `t/` means the set of input lesson time will replacee all existing set of lesson time for that student.

* Using the prefix `t+/` adds the set of input lesson time onto the existing set of lesson time for that student.

* Using the prefix `t-/` removes the set of input lesson time from the existing set of lesson time for that student.

* Prefix `t/` cannot be used together with prefix `t+/` and/or `t-/`, but prefix `t+/` and `t-/` can be used together in a single command.

</box>

* Edits the student at the specified `INDEX`.
* `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed student list.
* The `INDEX` must be a positive integer 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.

* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Marcus Ng` will match `Ng Marcus`.
* Names, phone numbers and lesson times or days can be searched.
* Partial matches within a word is supported. e.g. `Mar` will match `Marcus`.
* Students matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
  e.g. `Marcus 9876` will return `Marcus Ng (9876 1111)`, `John Tan (9876 5432)`.
* If in a group searching will return results in the group itself
* If no results shown is found, use command `list` to go back to student list

Examples:
* `search-student k/marcus` Returns `Marcus Ng` and `Marcus Tan`.
* `search-student k/9876` Returns all students whose phone number contains `9876`.

   * Matching is case-insensitive and partial matches are allowed. e.g. `marc` matches `Marcus`.

Examples:
1. Deleting by `INDEX`
   * `list` followed by `delete-student i/2` Deletes the 2nd person in the student list.
   * `search-student k/Marcus` followed by `delete-student i/1` Deletes the 1st person in the results of the `search-student` command.

2. Deleting by `KEYWORD`
   * `delete-student k/marcus` Deletes the student named `marcus` if only one match is found.
   * If multiple matches are found, the app will show possible matches.<br>
   ```
   Multiple students match the given keyword(s). Please refine your search:
   1. marcus tan; Phone: 98765432; Lesson Time: 10:00 am Sat;
   2. marcus ng; Phone: 98765423; Lesson Time: 10:00 am Mon;
   ```
   * You can then refine your search by including full name, phone number or lesson time. e.g. `delete-student k/98765432`.

</box>

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous ClassConnect home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
